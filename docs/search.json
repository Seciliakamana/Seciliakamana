    "text": "Skills & Abilities\n\nPhysics work relation:\n\nResearch roles\nEducation roles\nQuantitative\nDecision maker\nThis is the skill of using radioactive materials and equipment for medical diagnosis, testing, and treatment. Nuclear physicists can work in the health sector or collaborate with medical professionals to develop and improve nuclear medicine techniques.\n\n\n\nDesign of Experiments\n\nThis stands for design of experiments, which is the skill of conducting and analyzing controlled tests to understand how different variables affect the outcomes. Nuclear physicists use DOE to optimize their experiments, evaluate their hypotheses, and draw valid conclusions\n\n\n\nAnalytical skills\n\nThese are the skills of collecting, processing, and interpreting data using various methods and tools. Nuclear physicists need analytical skills to perform complex calculations, use statistical models, and apply scientific principles to their research\n\n\n\nCommunication Skills\n\nThese are the skills of expressing and exchanging information clearly and effectively with different audiences. Nuclear physicists need communication skills to write reports, present their findings, collaborate with other scientists, and teach students\n\n\n\nMath skills\n\nThese are the skills of using mathematics to solve problems and understand concepts. Nuclear physicists need math skills to apply advanced topics such as calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and numerical analysis to their work.\n\n\n\nComputing skills\n\nThese are the skills of using computers and software to perform tasks and functions. Nuclear physicists need computing skills to program simulations, model phenomena, visualize data, and operate instruments.\nMicrosoft Office & ICT issues"
